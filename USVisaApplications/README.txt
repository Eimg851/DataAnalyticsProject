COMP47350: Data Analytics Group Project

Predicting US Working Visa Applications

———————————————————

Our project code is contained across 5 Jupyter notebooks. Firstly, we have contained our data preparation and cleaning in the data cleaning notebook. Next, we detail how we narrowed down our variables of interest and employed further data cleaning to select our features in the feature analysis notebooks (one each for a balanced and unbalanced dataset). We train and test our data using logistic regression in the logistic regression modelling notebook. Finally we train and test our data using random forest modelling and evaluate our research in the random forest modelling notebook. Our notebooks are numbered for ease of navigation.

A requirements.txt file lists all the packages that we have used in this project. To install all required packages in one go, run the following command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

As well as the project code, we have included our initial project proposal slides and our project presentation slides from April 26th 2018. CSV files that were generated after the cleaning of the data, and the feature selection are also included. A description of all the acronyms included in the data and the notebooks are contained in the file ‘PERM_FY14_Record_Layout’.
